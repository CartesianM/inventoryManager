# inventoryManager

The following is one of my personal projects, following shortly after my perceptron build. This inventory manager
creates an inventory object in which you can store anything by using a name and a quantity
## CLI INTERFACE
when ran the Command line will show a series of options, where you can edit, update, delete the inventory
the inventory also has cross-program consistency via reading off CSV files, which you can do using the inventory 
method

I really enjoyed this project, learning about file manipulation, CLI search filtering and some other usefull functions
